# Chapter 5 - The New Date and Time API

## Task 1
Compute Programmer's Day without using `plusDays`.

## Task 2
What happens when you add one year to `LocalDate.of(2000, 2, 29)`? Four years ? Four times one year?

## Task 3
Implement a method `next` that takes a `Predicate<LocalDate>` and returns an adjuster yielding the next date fulfilling 
the predicate. For example,
```
    today.with(next(w -> getDayOfWeek().getValue() < 6))
```
computes the next workday.

## Task 4
Write an equivalent of the Unix `cal` program that displays a calendar for a month. For example, `java Cal 3 2013` 
should display
```
                 1  2  3
     4  5  6  7  8  9 10
    11 12 13 14 15 16 17
    18 19 20 21 22 23 24
    25 26 27 28 29 30 31
```
indicating that March 1 is a Friday. (Show the weekend at the end of the week.)

## Task 5
Write a program that prints how many days you have been alive.

## Task 6
List all Friday the 13th in the twentieth century.

## Task 7
Implement a `TimeInterval` class that represents an interval of time, suitable for calendar events (such as a meeting 
on a given date from 10:00 to 11:00). Provide a method to check whether two intervals overlap.

## Task 8
Obtain the offsets of today's date in all supported time zoned for the current time instant, turning 
`ZoneId.getAvailableIds` into a stream and using stream operations.

## Task 9
Again using stream operations, find all time zones whose offsets aren't full hours.

## Task 10
Your flight from Los Angeles to Frankfurt leaves at 3:05 pm local time and takes 10 hours and 50 minutes. When does it 
arrive? Write a program that can handle calculations like this.

## Task 11
Your return flight leaves Frankfurt at 14:05 and arrives in Los Angeles at 16:40. How long is the flight? Write a 
program that can handle calculations like this. 

## Task 12
Write a program that solves the problem described at the beginning of Section 5.5, "Zoned Time", on page 109. Read a 
set of appointments in different time zones and alert the User which ones are due within the next hour in local time.
